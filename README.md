`identify-type` is a JavaScript library of utility methods designed to quickly identify standard types without the need to refer to correct syntax.

**Key Features:**

üå≤ ES6 **Tree-Shaking** Support  
‚úàÔ∏è Bundled **TypeScript** Definitions  
ü´ô Zero Dependencies

## Installation

```bash
npm i identify-type
```

## Documentation

All functions accept an argument of any type and return a boolean indicating the answer to the query. If using TypeScript, types are also narrowed using type predicates.

### `isNumber`

```javascript
isNumber(3); // true
isNumber(NaN); // false
```
